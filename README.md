## Overview

1.There were couple of things that could have been better, such as the icons in Coins screen. It would've been great to have another API that returns URL of the icons and subnames of the coins we get from websocket API.

2.Home Page is very important and should be the "GO-TO" for the user. Made a few changes, I thought would enhance the Home screen, hope you like it.
